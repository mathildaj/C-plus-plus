# Project Description

This is a C++ application. This program reads a text file, extract all the integers from the file, then converts these integers (as degrees) to ASCII code.

The file includes the following classes:

1. FileIO -- handling the file input, and parsing the text to integers.
2. ConvertToAscii -- converting a vector of hex decimal numbers to Ascii code/string.
3. DegreeToAscii -- this is a class that calls the methods from the above three classes, and makes the conversion.
